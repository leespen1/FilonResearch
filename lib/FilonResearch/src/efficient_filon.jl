# =============================================================================
# Efficient Filon method for  dψ/dt = A(t) ψ,  A(t) = Σ_k c_k(t) A_k.
#
# This is the A_k-factored (Appendix B) reorganization of the *regular* Filon
# method (`filon_solve_hardcoded`), applied WITHOUT carrier resolution: the
# quadrature is split over each control matrix A_k and the time-derivatives are
# moved onto the scalar controls, so each distinct A_k is applied only s+1 times
# per step instead of the (s+1)(s+2)/2 applications of the regular method.  The
# ansatz frequencies ω enter only through the diagonal weight-phase matrices
# W^s_j(ω) and the envelope-derivative matrices F_m — each control c_k(t) (any
# carrier folded into the envelope) is differentiated as a generic scalar.
#
# Because each A_k is constant, this is the SAME approximation as
# `filon_solve_hardcoded` on the same operator — only the matrix-vector ordering
# differs — but with fewer dense products.  This is the ω ≠ 0 generalization of
# `efficient_controlled_hermite_solve` (which is its scalar-weight ω = 0 case).
#
# It is DISTINCT from two similarly named things:
#   * `filon_solve_hardcoded(; efficient=true)` reorders the *full-operator*
#     apply (Appendix A); it still applies the combined A(t) and its derivatives
#     (s+1)(s+2)/2 times and so costs (s+1)(s+2)/2·nHam dense matvecs — it does
#     NOT factor the individual A_k.
#   * `efficient_controlled_filon_solve` additionally RESOLVES each carrier into
#     frequency-shifted weights W^s_j(ω + ν); that is a different (carrier-aware)
#     approximation, not identical to regular Filon.
#
# Each step solves  S^s_I ψ_{n+1} = S^s_E ψ_n  with (Filon specialization of
# Appendix B, gathering the derivatives onto the scalar control)
#
#   S^s_* = I ± Σ_k A_k Σ_{m=0}^s [ G^s_{*,k,m} F_m ]_t ,
#   G^s_{*,k,m}(t) = Σ_{j=m}^s C(j,m) c_k^{(j-m)}(t) W^s_{*,j} ,
#
# where W^s_{*,j} = (Δt/2)^{j+1} diag( e^{∓i ω̂_m} b^{[-1,1],s}_{*,j}(ω_m Δt/2) )
# are the diagonal Filon weight-phase matrices (one set, shared across matrices —
# contrast the per-carrier weights of `efficient_controlled_filon_solve`) and
# * = E (explicit, +, at t_n) / I (implicit, −, at t_{n+1}).  The F_m ψ are
# computed once and reused:
#   F_0 = I,  F_1 = A - iΩ,  F_2 = Adot + A² - Ω² - 2iΩA   (A = full A(t), Ω = diag(ω)),
# building them applies each A_k once to ψ^{(0)},…,ψ^{(s-1)} (the per-matrix
# products A_k x are retained so Ax and Adotx share them), and each A_k is applied
# once more in the outer sum — s+1 applications in total.
#
# Only the dynamic (matrix-free `mul!` + GMRES) implementation is provided.  The
# runtime apply machinery (`_EffControlledDynWS`, `_eff_apply_M!`,
# `_EffControlledImplicit`, `_write_env_derivs!`) and the diagonal weight builder
# `_weight_phase_entries` are shared with the efficient-controlled-Filon and
# hard-coded-Filon files; this file must be `include`d after both.

    efficient_filon_solve(co, ψ0, frequencies, Δt, nsteps, s; kwargs...)

Solve `dψ/dt = A(t) ψ` with the **efficient Filon** method of order `s ∈ {0,1,2}`
(orders 2/4/6), where `co` is a [`ControlledOperator`](@ref) `A(t) = Σ_k c_k(t) A_k`
with one matrix per control Hamiltonian and `frequencies` are the ansatz
frequencies ω (one per state component).

This is the A_k-factored (Appendix B) reorganization of regular Filon: the
quadrature is split over each distinct matrix `A_k` and the derivatives are moved
onto the scalar controls, so each `A_k` is applied only `s+1` times per step
instead of `(s+1)(s+2)/2`.  The result is identical (to round-off) to
[`filon_solve_hardcoded`](@ref) on the same operator — only the matrix-vector
ordering differs — but uses fewer dense products.  Only the matrix-free (GMRES)
implementation is provided.

Any carrier in `c_k(t)` is folded into the control and differentiated as a
generic scalar; ω enters only through the diagonal weights.  This makes the method
**distinct** from:
  * `filon_solve_hardcoded(; efficient=true)`, which reorders the full-operator
    apply but still costs `(s+1)(s+2)/2·nHam` dense matvecs (it does not factor
    the individual `A_k`); and
  * [`efficient_controlled_filon_solve`](@ref), which instead **resolves** each
    carrier into shifted weights `W^s_j(ω + ν)` — a different approximation.
The ω = 0 scalar-weight specialization is [`efficient_controlled_hermite_solve`](@ref).

Pass `warm_start = true` to seed each GMRES solve with the previous step's
solution; it helps when GMRES takes several iterations (i.e. for systems larger
than a handful of states).

The keyword arguments (`save_every`, `save_final_only`, `warm_start`, `gmres_atol`,
`gmres_rtol`, `stats`) and the return value match [`filon_solve_hardcoded`](@ref):
an `N × nsaves` history matrix, or just the final state if `save_final_only`.
